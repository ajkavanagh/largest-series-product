# Largest Series Product in Rust, functional and imperative

This is an implementation to the exercism.io "largest Series Product" exercise.  I'm using exercism.io as a method to learn Rust and it's working very well (I hope).

This repository contains two implementations, one functional and the other a
mutable/imperative approach, along with benchmarking code to compare the
difference in efficienty.  This is part of a blog post in my series of posts
about learning Rust.
